# GSoC2020
This github page describes the work done on Eclipse APP4MC Project which is part of Eclipse Foundation Organization during the GSoC 2020.

# Proposal

This project aims at developing a tracing framework based on the BTF specification to generate trace
on Real Time Parallella Framework. The generated trace file can be viewed on external tools such as
Eclipse Trace Compass to analyse task events occurring on the processor core. It also aims at extending
the CDGen application to include the tracing functionality. The implementation is realized on Adapteva
Parallella hardware and will be integrated to the Eclipse APP4MC project.
